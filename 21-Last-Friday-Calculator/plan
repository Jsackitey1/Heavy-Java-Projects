## 🗝️ INTERACTIONS & PUZZLES

### 🔹 Bed

**Interaction:** Look under it.  
**Outcome:** You find a **coat hanger**, bent out of shape. Might be good for lock-picking or reaching tight spaces.

---

### 🔹 Desk & Drawer

**Interaction:** The drawer is locked with a 3-digit combo.  
**Hint:** The right combo is somewhere in the room — perhaps hidden in plain sight.

**Clue location:** Inside a book titled _“Room of Riddles”_ on the bookshelf, the code "243" is underlined.

**Outcome:** Use the coat hanger to help pry the drawer slightly open, then input the combo. You find a **journal with notes** and a **flashlight** with no batteries.

---

### 🔹 Closet

**Interaction:** Search inside the jacket.  
**Outcome:** You find **AA batteries**. You insert them into the flashlight.

---

### 🔹 Painting

**Interaction:** Move it aside.  
**Outcome:** Behind it is a **mini-safe with no lock, just screws**.  
Use the **screwdriver** (found later) to open it — inside is a **journal entry from a parent revealing they once hid in a crawlspace behind the bookshelf as a child**.

---

### 🔹 Bookshelf

**Interaction:** Pull out books. One titled _“Hidden Spaces”_ clicks when tilted.  
**Outcome:** A low _clunk_ sound reveals the shelf can slide.

Slide the bookshelf aside to reveal a **narrow opening**, but it’s too dark to enter safely.

Use **flashlight** to light the path. Inside is a **vent opening**... but it’s sealed with screws.

---

### 🔹 Vent

**Interaction:** Examine the vent.  
**Outcome:** Screws are visible. Use **screwdriver** (found in the painting safe) to remove them. The vent opens, leading to a vertical shaft.

As you crawl in, the shaft dips into an old **dumbwaiter-like chute** used for laundry in older homes.

---

### 🔹 Carpet

**Optional Puzzle:** Lift the carpet — you find a trapdoor. It’s sealed tight.  
Use coat hanger or screwdriver? No luck. It’s rusted shut and jammed.

**Outcome:** Red herring path. It adds tension but isn’t the true exit.

---

## 🧩 ESCAPE SEQUENCE (Final Path)

1. **Explore bookshelf** ➝ find journal note about crawlspace.
2. **Slide bookshelf** ➝ reveal dark crawlspace.
3. **Find flashlight & batteries** ➝ illuminate crawlspace.
4. **Find screwdriver** ➝ remove vent screws.
5. **Crawl into vent** ➝ drop into an old dumbwaiter chute.
6. **Slide down** safely and quietly into the kitchen pantry on the ground floor.
7. **You’ve escaped the bedroom — without touching the door or window!**

## 🏆 ENDING

> _You tumble into the pantry and stumble upright. You're free. You hear no voices. The house is eerily quiet. Was it a prank? A mistake? You’ll figure that out later. For now, you've won your freedom — the clever way._
