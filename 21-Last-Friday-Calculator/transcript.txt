Escape the Bedroom - No Door, No Window

You awaken in a random bedroom on the second floor a hotel.
Something feels off — the door is locked from the outside.
The window overlooks a steep backyard ravine, making any attempt to jump suicidal.
No one answers your calls for help.

You begin to explore. There has to be a way out.
